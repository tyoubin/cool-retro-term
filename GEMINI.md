## Bug Fixes (2025-11-28)

-   **Application hangs on quit (macOS Apple Silicon)**:
    -   **Problem**: The application would hang when quitting using `Cmd+Q` or closing the window on macOS Apple Silicon, while `Ctrl+D` would quit cleanly. This was traced to `_shellProcess->waitForFinished()` in `qmltermwidget/lib/Session.cpp` blocking indefinitely if the underlying shell process didn't terminate quickly after receiving a `SIGHUP` signal.
    -   **Solution**: Removed the blocking call to `_shellProcess->waitForFinished()` from `Session::sendSignal()` in `qmltermwidget/lib/Session.cpp`. This allows the application to rely on the asynchronous `finished()` signal of the shell process for proper cleanup, preventing the hang.
    -   **Build Issue During Fix**: After modifying `Session.cpp`, a build error occurred due to `qmake` caching an outdated absolute path (`cool-retro-term-reloaded`) for copying `color-schemes` and `kb-layouts`.
    -   **Build Issue Resolution**: Performed a `make clean` in the `qmltermwidget` directory, followed by a full `make clean` for the entire project, and then `qmake -r cool-retro-term.pro && make`. This forced `qmake` to regenerate all Makefiles with correct paths, successfully resolving the build issue.
